# Skrud or Pizza: World Tournament

## About

a small game. 

i had a housewarming once. the doorbell rang. "who is that?" someone wondered. "it is either skrud or pizza," another answered.

a game was born.

the original game was built using Unity's web player, which has become deprecated as web standards moved relentlessly onward; i've rebuilt the project slightly, bringing it forward into the current cultural moment; the zeitgeist, if you will. the world tournament edition once featured online scoreboards, but i can't be bothered to re-implement that. nonetheless this is approximately the correct, original experience.

we love you skrud, wherever you are.

we also love pizza.

## Project setup

images 1-15.png in `Assets/Images/Skrud` must be replaced with images of skrud, provided by the user, for personal use.

## Gameplay

1-4 players log in by pressing various buttons on the keyboard.

then they are shown a sequence of images, and have to identify whether the image is skrud, or pizza.
